#QUIZTIME

Quiztime is a Python terminal game that uses the mock terminal by Code Institute on Heroku.

This general knowledge quiz is played by one player. Can they beat their own target?

## HOW TO PLAY

Quiztime is a general knowledge game where a player answers questions, having 4 alternatives to choose from. The questions are taken from a range of subjects. The game continues until all 10 questions are answered.

### Features

The player first enters their name and then a target score for them to try and beat. This score is out of 10.
The player will then be shown 10 questions and the 4 alternative answers. The players enter their answers by pressing the A, B, C or D keys on the keyboard and pressing enter. Their score is checked and then the correct answer is shown. Their running score is logged. Once the 10th question is answered and that score checked then the final score is revealed.

### Existing features
